# Task 2 - Add a Service Request app to Teams

In the SharePoint lab that you previously completed, you created a ticketing system and an app to access the help service from your desktop.

	2. Select the **Apps icon** in the navigation pane. 

	3. In the **Search bar** type **“PowerApps.”**

	4. Select **PowerApps**.

	5. Select **Add to a team.**

	6. Select inside the new search window and select **Contoso General.**

	7. Select **setup a tab**.

	8. Select **Service Request App**

	9. Select **Save.**

	10. In the General Channel there will be a new Tab added that will display the tickets that have been created and you can now directly add tickets to the service now from teams.

 

Go ahead and have your Student Colleagues access your teams and submit tickets and explore the apps inside Teams.
